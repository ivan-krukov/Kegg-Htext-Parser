KEGG HTEXT parser
====
This is a parser of the Kyoto Genes and Genomes Encyclopedia HTEXT format.
A work in progress, a python executable accepts a correct .keg file and produces a parsable table.
Tables are handled by tablib (of kennethreitz).
There will be support for sqlite3 at some point.
Thus far, it only supports Enzyme to KO maps.
More features to come.
